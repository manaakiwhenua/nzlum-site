# New Zealand Land-use Steering Group (NZLUSG)

The **NZLUSG** is a technical advisory body established to guide the long-term development, stewardship, and governance of the **New Zealand Land Use Management (NZLUM)** classification system.

NZLUSG aims to bring together representatives from central and regional government, research organisations, and industry to ensure that New Zealand's land-use data remains **coordinated, authoritative, future-proof, and nationally consistent**.

## Why NZLUSG is necessary

High-quality, consistent land-use information is fundamental for policy, planning, environmental reporting, and long-term land stewardship. Land-use maps have been made in the past on an ad-hoc and regional basis, rather than systematically and nationally. One reason for this is thought to be the lack of a dedicated governance mechanism to ensure:

- Continuity and maintenance of a national classification standard.  
- Coordination across producers, users, and stewards of land-use data.
- Transparent decision-making on updates and revisions.
- Resilience and longevity of the dataset beyond any single project.  
- Alignment with international best practice (e.g., Australia's ABARES model).

NZLUSG is being established to secure the continuity of this vital dataset, protect its public-good value, and provide a collaborative forum for ongoing improvements.

## Terms of Reference

The NZLUSG Terms of Reference (ToR) outline the group's **purpose, structure, responsibilities, and operating principles**.  
They define how decisions will be made, how updates to NZLUM will be governed, and how external stakeholders may contribute.

**Download the Terms of Reference:**  
[NZLUSG Draft Terms of Reference (PDF)](/lc4488.pdf)  

The ToR was co-developed through consultation at a December 2024 seminar and through written feedback from agencies and stakeholders.

### Background: Seminar and Stakeholder Consultation

The formation of NZLUSG was shaped by feedback gathered during the seminar:

**_Advancing New Zealand's Land-Use Classification: Insights and Governance_**  
*2 December 2024*  
*Mercure Wellington Abel Tasman Hotel*

This event brought together researchers, land managers, central and regional government, consultants, and industry groups to discuss:

- National land-use classification practices and needs.  
- Governance frameworks in New Zealand.
- Data methodologies and use-cases.
- The operational model for a national advisory group.

Dr. **Jane Stewart** ([ABARES](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares)) delivered the keynote, sharing lessons from Australia's two decades of land-use governance and standardisation, and their [Australian Land-use and Management (ALUM) classification system](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/aclump/land-use/alum-classification).

The afternoon workshop focused on reviewing and discussing a **draft Terms of Reference** for NZLUSG, with participants providing input on scope, structure, membership, and responsibilities.
