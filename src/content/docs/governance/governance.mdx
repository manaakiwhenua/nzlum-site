# New Zealand Land-use Data Advisory Group (NZLAG)

The **New Zealand Land-use Data Advisory Group (NZLAG)** is a national body established to guide the long-term development, stewardship, and governance of the **New Zealand Land Use Management (NZLUM)** classification system.

NZLAG brings together representatives from central government, regional councils, research organisations, and industry to ensure that New Zealand’s land-use data remains **coordinated, authoritative, future-proof, and nationally consistent**.

## Why NZLAG Is Needed

High-quality, consistent land-use information is fundamental for policy, planning, environmental reporting, and long-term land stewardship in Aotearoa. However, New Zealand has historically lacked a **dedicated governance mechanism** to ensure:

- continuity and maintenance of a national classification standard  
- coordination across producers, users, and stewards of land-use data  
- transparent decision-making on updates and revisions  
- resilience and longevity of the dataset beyond any single project  
- alignment with international best practice (e.g., Australia’s ABARES model)

NZLAG is being established to **secure the continuity of this vital dataset**, protect its public-good value, and provide a collaborative forum for ongoing improvements.

## Terms of Reference

The NZLAG Terms of Reference (ToR) outline the group’s **purpose, structure, responsibilities, and operating principles**.  
They define how decisions will be made, how updates to NZLUM will be governed, and how external stakeholders may contribute.

**Download the Terms of Reference:**  
[NZLAG Draft Terms of Reference (PDF)](/lc4488.pdf)  

The ToR was co-developed through consultation at the December 2024 seminar and through written feedback from agencies and stakeholders.

## Background: Seminar and Stakeholder Consultation

The formation of NZLAG was shaped by feedback gathered during the seminar:

**_Advancing New Zealand’s Land-Use Classification: Insights and Governance_**  
*2 December 2024*  
*Mercure Wellington Abel Tasman Hotel*

This event brought together researchers, land managers, central and regional government, consultants, and industry groups to discuss:

- national land-use classification practices and needs  
- governance frameworks in New Zealand
- data methodologies and use-cases  
- the operational model for a national advisory group  

Dr. **Jane Stewart** (ABARES) delivered the keynote, sharing lessons from Australia’s two decades of land-use governance and standardisation.

The afternoon workshop focused on reviewing and discussing the **draft Terms of Reference** for NZLAG, with participants providing input on scope, structure, membership, and responsibilities.
