## Geographic scale

The intended geographic unit of this classification system is the **property parcel**.  
However, it may be appropriate to map **sub-parcel geographic entities** for particular classes - particularly if the boundary of natural features (forests, waterways) is pertinent, if the parcel is very large, and where source-data scale permits such definition.

Whether to map sub-parcel areas is therefore left to **operator discretion**, but the intended and minimum level of attribution is the **property parcel**, and therefore property-parcel identifiers and geographic boundaries **must be present** in output land-use data.

## Source scale

`source_scale`

To indicate that one of the endpoints is to be excluded from the set, use a **parenthesis** and not a square bracket (the latter indicates inclusion).

For example:
- If source data is precise between 0.02 m and 0.75 m, use the notation `(0,1)`, indicating precision at the sub-metre scale, between 0–1 m (but not including the endpoints).  
- If vector data is no more precise than 60 m, use `[60,)` if there is no suitable upper bound; or else determine an appropriate nominal upper bound (e.g. `[60,x]`, where `x > 60`) since it is unlikely that in reality there is no upper bound.

**Rules of thumb for converting nominal scales of input data to this notation:**

- **Raster data pixel size:**  
  Given the smaller of the pixel height or width (a) and the larger (b): `[a,b]`.  
  If `a = b`, this notation remains valid (`[a,a]` = the singleton set `{a}`; `(a,a)` would be empty).  
  Example: a raster with 30 m pixels → `[30,30]`.

- **1:50 000 scale map data:**  
  Precision = (map-scale denominator) / 1 000.  
  Example: a 1:50 000 scale map has positional precision ≈ 50 m → `[50,)` (with optional practical or QA-derived upper limit).

- **Derived data from mixed sources:**  
  A map produced from raster data with 10 m pixels, manually digitised at 1:25 000 scale →  
  Precision = 10 + (25 000 / 1 000) = 35 m → `[35,)` (with optional upper limit).

When **multiple input datasets** are used together to inform a classification decision,  
the ranges should be **merged** - compute the smallest interval that includes all given ranges  
(e.g. PostgreSQL `range_merge` function).  
Example: `[1,2)` and `[3,4)` → `[1,4)`.

## Temporality

**Interannual.**  
A crop planted for a whole year is a *commodity*, but not necessarily a *land use* -  
for instance, if it forms part of a livestock-farm system.  
The **primary economic purpose over an interannual period** is the determining factor  
for assigning a land-use class.
