**NZLUM** adapts the **Australian Land Use and Management (ALUM v8)** classification for New Zealand, aligning with national datasets and frameworks such as **SOE soil quality monitoring** (Cavanagh & Whitehead 2022, 2023)<sup>1 2</sup>, **Waikato Integrated Scenario Explorer** (Rutledge et al. 2016)<sup>3</sup>, **Land Use Database version 4** (Price et al. 2010)<sup>4</sup>, **NZ Planning Standards** (MfE 2019)<sup>5</sup>, and **LINZ rating rules**(2010)<sup>6</sup>.

## Purpose and Adaptation

ALUM provides a strong data structure for standardisation. Its [CC-BY 3.0 Australia Licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au) explicitly allows adaptation.  
While many ALUM classes are retained, NZLUM significantly restructures the hierarchy and adds classes relevant to Aotearoa New Zealand.

#### Key Changes from ALUM v8

- **Irrigation removed** as a primary class; it is now a *management practice* attribute.  
- **Water** removed as a primary class; it is now treated as a *land-cover attribute* (`river`, `lake`, etc.).  

---
## Treatment of Water

Rather than defining water as a land-use class, NZLUM records it as an attribute with a **controlled vocabulary** (e.g., `lake`, `reservoir`, `river`, `wetland`, `marine`).  
Subtypes (e.g., `wetland bog`, `marine inshore`).

Due to the significance of water for Māori- further engagement with iwi/Māori is needed to finalise water representation, recognising its unique cultural and environmental significance.

---
## Attribute Framework

NZLUM follows ALUM’s approach of **attributes** to land-use classes to record additional information (e.g. `land management practices`, or `commodities` ) using defined terminology.  

*These attributes are optional, but they should be included where information permits.*

### Proposed Attributes

- **Commodity:** *As in ALUM V8*,  captures information about crops and livestock (useful for biosecurity, economic modelling, nutrient modelling, greenhouse gas estimation, site-selection, etc.).  
- **Management practice:** *As in ALUM V8*, operational details such as irrigation, rotations, dairy wintering off, etc.  
- **Tenure:** `land_estate` and `land_status` Reflect ownership or rights affecting land use.  
- **Zoning:** such as described from NZ Planning Standards (2019) for linking planning and use.  
- **Land cover:** current land cover at time of mapping for crop rotation or mapping context.  
- **Permeability:** sealed / unsealed surfaces, especially in built environments.  
- **Water:** controlled terms as above.

**Attributes** are **categorical**; continuous data (e.g., stocking rate) should be stored separately or discretised.

<Aside type="tip">
Attributes allow reclassification and filtering (e.g. irrigated vs. non-irrigated, or sealed vs. unsealed surfaces) without changing the base land-use class.

## Summary

NZLUM offers a **general-purpose** classification for modelling and environmental management in New Zealand.  
It balances ALUM’s standardisation with local context, and flexibility for future adaptation.
