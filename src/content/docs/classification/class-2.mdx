## 2.0.0 Production agriculture and plantations

 This class includes land used principally for primary production, where native vegetation has largely been replaced by introduced species through clearing, the sowing of new species, the application of fertilisers or the dominance of volunteer species. The range of activities in this category includes plantation forests, pasture production for stock, cropping and fodder production, and a wide range of horticultural production. If there is evidence of irrigation infrastructure or water-take consents, land should have irrigation listed as a management practice, even if it appears that irrigation water has not been recently applied.

Fallow or ploughed land should be assigned to the most likely land use based on the dominant activity conducted in comparable nearby areas or other available evidence. Fallow or ploughed land should be allocated to the relevant pasture, cropping or horticultural class (rather than using land in transition). The fallow or ploughed status should be recorded in the management field.

### 2.1.0 Plantation forests

This is land on which plantations of trees or shrubs (native or exotic species) have been established (i.e. planted) for production, or environmental and resource protection purposes. This includes farm forestry and may consist of monocultures or mixed species. Specific additional attributes that could be captured are plantation age, rotation number, and species.

<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="2.1.1 Exotic plantation forestry">
    An area managed for pulpwood or saw-log production (exotic species).
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.1.2 Indigenous plantation forestry">
    An area managed for pulpwood or saw-log production (native species).
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.1.3 Other production uses">
    An area managed for non-pulpwood production, including oil, wildflowers, honey (e.g. kānuka/mānuka plantations).
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.1.4 Planted environmental & infrastructure protection">
    An area managed for environmental and indirect production uses (e.g. prevention of land degradation, windbreaks, shade, and shelter).
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.1.5 Permanent carbon forest">
    An area planted with indigenous or exotic trees for the purpose of gaining carbon credits (carbon farming).
  </TabItem>

### 2.2.0 Grazing modified pasture systems

This class includes grazing pasture and/or forage, both annual and perennial, based on significant active modification or replacement of the natural vegetation. Land under pasture at the time of mapping may be in a rotation system, so that at another time the same area may be, for example, under cropping.

The ability to distinguish between dairy and dry-stock production is provided by including the relevant commodity information, such as `cattle dairy`, `cattle beef`, `sheep wool`, `sheep meat`, etc. Multiple commodities should be recorded if appropriate. Crops used in rotation should also be recorded as commodities, if known.

Dairy support is land that is used to support non-lactating dairy stock (dry cows, heifers and calves). It will include any feed required, and will often include winter crops and potentially summer crops (location/irrigation dependent), along with cereal crops, such as maize, barley, and wheat. It can also include feed that is cut and carried to the milking platform. Dairy support land that is not actively used for grazing should be classified as an arable use.

<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="2.2.1 Dairy">
    The land on which milking cows (or other stock, such as goats or sheep) are grazed during the milking season. Dairy production systems can include rotations of grazed forage crops and maize for silage, and dry-stock grazing, but this class should only be used where dairy is the primary purpose of the land. Where the land is permanently used for dry-stock grazing, it should be classified under dry-stock land use.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.2.2 Intensive dry stock">
    Includes non-milking platform pasture where there is a high level of inputs from fertiliser, water requirements (i.e. may be irrigated), and high stocking rates. This is most likely to occur on flat/rolling terrain. Land used for high-intensity dry-stock grazing may include rotations for arable or winter forage crops, as well as grazing of non-lactating (dry) dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, and cattle breeding. Grazing of other stock, including deer, goats, and horses, should be captured under class ‘2.2.3 Extensive dry stock’.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.2.3 Extensive dry stock">
    As for class 2.2.2, but for grazing on modified pastures with relatively fewer inputs, lower likelihood of irrigation, and lower stocking rates. This is more likely to take place on hill, hard-hill, or high-country terrain. Grazing livestock other than dairy, sheep or beef should usually be captured in this class (though it does not exclude sheep or beef), and the commodity type appropriately recorded. Where there is a high proportion of indigenous vegetation for grazing land, land use should be classified as grazing native vegetation. Arable or winter forage crops are unlikely to be common rotations in this land-use category.
  </TabItem>

### 2.3.0 Short-rotation and seasonal cropping

This class includes agricultural practices characterised by the cultivation of crops with rapid turnover cycles and seasonal planting patterns, typically optimised for efficient land use and high-yield production. This class encompasses agricultural activities such as the cultivation of fast-growing crops such as maize, barley, and certain vegetables, often rotated on short-term cycles to maintain soil health and maximise productivity. Arable, and mixed livestock cropping, integrating both crop cultivation and animal husbandry, is also included in this class.

If the type of crop is known, record this in the commodity field. For mixed arable and livestock operations, both commodities should be captured as the primary commodity (neither is ancillary).

<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="2.3.1 Arable cropping">
    Predominantly grain, seed, or fodder crops; over time it may include vegetable rotations. Includes maize, barley, wheat, peas, other grain and seed crops, and fodder crops. May be used for dairy support (which should be recorded as a management practice if this is known). If the crop type(s) is (are) known, record it (them) in the commodity field using the commodity list.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.3.2 Arable and mixed livestock cropping">
    Predominantly grain, seed, or fodder crops; over time it may include short-term (c. 1–3 years) pasture and livestock rotations, and/or vegetable rotations. Pasture and livestock rotations may occur less than 50% of the time. Includes maize, barley, wheat, peas, other grain and seed crops, and fodder crops. May be used for dairy support (which should be recorded as a management practice, if this is known). If the crop type(s) is (are) known, record it (them) in the commodity field using the commodity list.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.3.3 Short-rotation horticulture">
    Crop plants living for <em>less than 2 years</em> that are intensively cultivated, usually involving a relatively high degree of nutrient, weed, and moisture control. Predominantly rotations of vegetable crops or seasonal fruits grown for human consumption; may include livestock rotations, but this is considered less likely.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.3.4 Seasonal flowers and bulbs, and turf farming">
    Agricultural practices focused on the cultivation of seasonal ornamental flowers, bulbs, and turf grass for commercial purposes. This class encompasses activities such as the cultivation of flowers and bulbs for seasonal markets, landscaping, and turf-farming for sports fields, lawns, and recreational areas.
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### 2.4.0 Perennial horticulture

This class includes crop plants living for more than 2 years that are intensively cultivated, usually involving a relatively high degree of nutrient, weed, and moisture control. Management practices such as irrigation or netting to protect crops from hail or birds can be recorded as management practices. Crop type can be recorded as the commodity and used to identify key crops (e.g. kiwifruit, avocados, and grapes).

<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="2.4.1 Tree crops">
    Includes long-term cultivated plants, typically trees or woody shrubs, grown for their fruits, nuts, or other edible parts. These crops require intensive management practices aimed at ensuring optimal growth, productivity, and quality over multiple years. Examples include orchard fruits such as olives, apples, oranges, and apricots, as well as tree nuts such as hazelnuts, macadamias, and chestnuts, which should be recorded in the commodity attribute, if known. Management practices may include pruning, pest and disease control, irrigation, and harvesting techniques specific to tree crops.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.4.2 Vine fruits">
    Includes fruit-bearing plants that grow on vines or trailing stems, often requiring support structures such as trellises or arbours. These plants produce fruits that typically hang from vines and may include grapes, kiwifruit, and passionfruit. Vine fruit cultivation involves specific management practices such as pruning, training, trellising, and pest and disease control specific to vine plants.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.4.3 Other perennial horticulture">
    Encompasses perennial plants beyond tree crops and vine fruits, such as berries (e.g. strawberries, blueberries), perennial herbs (e.g. lavender, rosemary), and ornamental perennials (e.g. roses, lilies).
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### 2.5.0 Intensive horticulture

This class includes intensive forms of plant production, often with special-purpose improvements used for horticultural production. If crop type is known, record this in the commodity field. Similarly, management practices such as hydroponic systems should be captured when known.

<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="2.5.1 Production nurseries">
    Specialised intensive horticultural facilities dedicated to propagating and growing plants for commercial purposes. These nurseries focus on cultivating a wide range of plant species, including ornamentals, fruit trees, and shrubs, typically for landscaping, reforestation, or ornamental purposes. Nurseries may be outdoor (exposed) or under cover. Production nurseries may employ advanced techniques such as grafting, tissue culture, and controlled environment systems to optimise plant growth and quality.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.5.2 Glasshouses/shadehouses">
    Controlled-environment structures utilised within intensive horticulture for protected cultivation of plants, including both vegetable and floriculture production. Glasshouses provide a transparent enclosure, typically made of glass or plastic, allowing natural sunlight to penetrate while shielding plants from adverse weather conditions. Shadehouses utilise shade cloth or netting to regulate light exposure and temperature levels. These structures enable year-round production of a wide variety of crops, including vegetables, herbs, flowers, and ornamental plants.
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### 2.6.0 Intensive animal production

This class covers intensive forms of non-pastoral animal production, livestock production facilities or animal-holding yards. The animal type can be recorded as a commodity. The management field can be used to record practices such as free range or organic. Further development of this category is likely to be required to ensure it is fit for purpose.

<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="2.6.1 Intensive animal containment">
    Facilities or systems designed to confine and manage animals, often including feed lots, pens, dairy sheds and yards, and herd homes where animals are raised intensively for meat production or other purposes.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.6.2 Poultry farms">
    Specialised facilities dedicated to the intensive production of domestic fowl, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese, typically for meat or egg production.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.6.3 Piggeries">
    Facilities designed for the intensive rearing of pigs, where large numbers of pigs are housed and managed for meat production.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.6.4 Horse studs">
    Establishments focused on the breeding and raising of horses, typically specialising in selective breeding for desirable traits.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.6.5 Aquaculture">
    The controlled cultivation of aquatic organisms, such as fish, molluscs, or algae in natural or artificial environments, typically for food production, but also for stock feeds, pharmaceutical uses, biofuels, etc.
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### 2.8.0 Land in transition

As a subclass of ‘Production agriculture and plantations’, land categorised under this class must recently have been used for agriculture or plantations. In the case of greenfield development, where it is known that the land use is in transition to a built-environment category (e.g. due to a zoning change), classify the land under 3.9.0 ‘Vacant and transitioning land’, or a further subclass thereof.

<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="2.8.1 Unused degraded land">
    Unused land that is degraded through erosion or flood events that is not being rehabilitated. Can include contaminated land.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.8.2 No defined use">
    Land cleared of vegetation and where the current proposed land use is unknown.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.8.3 Land undergoing rehabilitation">
    Land in the process of rehabilitation for agricultural production (e.g. after significant flooding), and which is actively being recovered.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="2.8.4 Abandoned land">
    Land where a previous pattern of agriculture may be observed but that is not currently under production, but not due to physical land degradation.
  </TabItem>
