## 3.0.0 Built environment

This class captures land uses that involve high levels of interference with natural processes, generally in association with the built environment of closer settlement and supporting infrastructure. The level of intervention may be high enough to completely remodel the natural landscape – the vegetation, surface and groundwater systems, and land surface.
    
However, land used for active recreational purposes and/or tourism (e.g. mountain bike parks) outside of urban areas and that are not captured in other land-use categories may be captured under the ‘Outdoor recreation’ category, which is a subclass of the built environment, though may still retain much natural character.

---

### 3.1.0 Residential

This captures land uses primarily designated for private, long-term human habitation, encompassing a variety of housing types and densities.

The following subclasses are proposed. Some alignment with the National Planning Standards (Zone Framework Standard) (MfE 2019) has been considered in the development of these classes. This information (as at time of classification) should be captured in the zone attribute to allow for some reclassification and specification.

The class includes holidays homes, retirement villages, student hostels and other forms of low-turnover or longer-term accommodation, even if these are run commercially. Shorter-term forms of accommodation (motels, hotels, holiday parks, etc.) are captured under ‘3.3.0 Commercial’ or ‘3.3.3 Hospitality’.

<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="3.1.1 High-density residential">
    Areas characterised by a high concentration of housing units per unit of land area, typically in multi-storey buildings or high-rise developments, often found in urban centres supporting high population density.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="3.1.2 Medium-density residential">
    Areas featuring a moderate concentration of housing units per unit of land area, typically in the form of townhouses, semi-detached, terraced, or low-rise apartment buildings, often situated in suburban or semi-urban settings in large cities, or central areas of provincial towns. Alignment to the Medium Density Residential Standards (MfE 2022) should be considered.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="3.1.3 Low-density residential">
    Residential properties within urban boundaries that fall within large-lot or low-density residential zones and are often single-family, one- to two-storey houses with yards and landscaping and lower population density.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="3.1.4 Rural residential">
    Residential properties with low-intensity (non-commercial) land management practices (e.g. hobby farms) on land in rural or peri-urban areas. Typically featuring larger parcel sizes amidst agricultural or natural surroundings. Concordant with the ‘Rural lifestyle zone’ from the Zone Framework Standard.
  </TabItem>

### 3.2.0 Public recreation and services

This land-use type includes land designated for recreational facilities and community amenities, serving the recreational needs and essential functions of the local population.

<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="3.2.1 Outdoor recreation">
    Land areas dedicated to leisure activities conducted in natural or semi-natural settings, such as parks, trails, beaches, sportsgrounds, camping grounds, zoos, botanic gardens, recreational reserves, sports grounds, tourist parks, mountain bike parks, etc. with a primary purpose of recreation and culture and typically with considerable unsealed vegetated areas.

    These often cater to activities such as tramping, cycling, picnicking, and wildlife observation.

    Parks or reserves with a high level of native bush or that are protected areas should be classified under class 1.

    The specific identification of this land is intended to enable more ready identification of urban green space. However, this category may also be used to identify recreational areas that fall outside urban boundaries, such as mountain-bike parks.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="3.2.2 Indoor recreation">
    Facilities designed for recreational activities conducted within enclosed or semi-enclosed structures, including sports centres, gyms, fitness clubs, swimming pools, and indoor sports arenas.
