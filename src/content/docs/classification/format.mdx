description: Requirements and recommendations for spatial data formats and coordinate reference systems

## Data format

**Vector data format:**  
[GeoPackage v1.4.0 or later](https://www.geopackage.org/spec130/index.html) and/or [GeoParquet v1.0.0 or later](https://geoparquet.org/).

Raster data (or other formats) may be produced for user convenience, but **no particular format is specified**, due to the lack of wide acceptance of a raster data format that supports attribute tables.  
Vector data is **mandatory** for classification output.

## Coordinate system

Any current **official projection** may be used:

| Projection name | Acronym | EPSG Code | Typical usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **New Zealand Transverse Mercator 2000** | NZTM2000 | `2193` | Default national coordinate system for mainland New Zealand.|
| **NZGD Meridional Circuits** | -- | `2105-2132` | Used for regional extracts or offshore islands (e.g. Auckland Islands, Chatham Islands).|
| **New Zealand Continental Shelf Lambert Conformal 2000** | NZCS2000 | `17964` | Used for offshore and continental-shelf mapping where scale preservation over large areas is important. |
