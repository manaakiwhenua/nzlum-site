title: Land Tenure
description: Attributes describing land ownership and governance context
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


Information relating to land tenure should be captured in two attributes: `land_estate` and `land_status`.  
How land is owned, and by whom, is an important consideration for how land may be used or managed.  
This information is included because it directly participates in the intended use of the land-use classification system, though it is auxiliary.

### `land_estate`

Controlled vocabulary of types of tenure in New Zealand:

- `freehold` or _(to be more specific)_ `māori freehold`, i.e. estate in fee simple  
- `leasehold` or _(to be more specific)_ `crown leasehold` (e.g. a Crown pastoral lease)  
- `cross lease`  
- `stratum estate`, i.e. forms of unit title, according to whether land that has been subdivided was freehold or leasehold; `stratum estate in freehold`, `stratum estate in leasehold` _(to be more specific)_

### `land_status`

A non-exhaustive list of land-status types organised along a gradient from Crown (public) to private.

<Aside>
_To be determined_: a controlled vocabulary to describe these by reference to some systematic grouping and authoritative list of terms.
