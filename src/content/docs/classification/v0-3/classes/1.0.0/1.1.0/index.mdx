<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="1.1.1 Strict nature reserve">
    Protected area managed mainly for science. An area of land possessing outstanding or representative ecosystems, geological or physiological features or species, which is available primarily for scientific research and/or environmental monitoring. **(IUCN 2008 Category Ia.)**
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="1.1.2 Wilderness area">
    Protected area managed mainly for wilderness protection. A large area of unmodified or slightly modified land, retaining its natural character and influence, without permanent or significant habitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural condition. **(IUCN 2008 Category Ib.)**
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="1.1.3 National park">
    Protected area managed mainly for ecosystem conservation and recreation. A natural area of land, designated to:

    a) protect the ecological integrity of one or more ecosystems for the current and future generations;

    b) exclude exploitation or occupation detrimental to the purposes of designation of the area; and

    c) provide a foundation for spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities, all of which must be environmentally and culturally compatible. **(IUCN 2008 Category II.)**
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="1.1.4 Natural feature protection">
    Protected area managed for conservation of specific natural features. An area containing one or more specific natural or cultural features that are of outstanding value because of their inherent rarity, representative or aesthetic qualities, or cultural significance. **(IUCN 2008 Category III.)**
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="1.1.5 Habitat or species management area">
    Protected area managed mainly for conservation through management intervention. An area of land or sea subject to active intervention for management purposes to ensure the maintenance of habitats or to meet the requirements of specific species. This may include areas on private land. **(IUCN 2008 Category IV.)**
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="1.1.6 Protected landscape">
    Protected area managed mainly for landscape conservation and recreation. An area of land where the interaction of people and nature over time had produced a distinct character with significant aesthetic, cultural or ecological value, and often high biodiversity. **(IUCN 2008 Category V.)**
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="1.1.7 Other conserved area">
    Land under forms of nature conservation protection that fall outside the scope of the CAPAD classification. This includes heritage agreements, voluntary conservation arrangements, registered property agreements, and recreation areas with primarily native cover (if the recreation area is primarily cleared or non-native cover assign to 3.2.1 ‘Outdoor recreation').
